This is a minimalistic homemade shell. It is built to mimick the real 
shell (sh) program. It is currently under development. The current release is:
Simple shell 0.1.

Simple shell 0.1. can handle the following:
- Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
- The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
- The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
- The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
- If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
- Handle errors.
- You have to handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)

More improvements on the way...
